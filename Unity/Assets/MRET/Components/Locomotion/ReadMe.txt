Overview: Locomotion Configuration Manager is an easy way for a MRET user to edit the scalar values of the locomotion systems.

Controlled under the “Locomotion Configuration Manager” where users can input different variables and press “apply” to change the value of fly speed, arm swing speed, touchpad locomotion and the laser’s raycast distance.

None of the VRTK scripts are edited, it is all done outside of them using “adjustable” scripts.
